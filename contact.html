      <h1>The Importance of Responsive Design</h1>
      <h2>A quick note on an important topic!</h2>
      <p>In years past, the consideration of differing screen sizes wasn't in the forefront of peoples' minds. Anything designed for the web was primarily focused on making it look good on a typical size computer monitor. In today’s age display size has become so incredibly varied that beautiful, responsive design isn’t just a bonus; it’s a necessity. Web users today also expect to move fluidly from one device to another. </p>
      <p>Additional considerations for developers are the advantages of having improved search engine optimization (searches from mobile phones have different search algorithms), the ability to easily adapt your sites to new emerging technology of changing sizes and resolutions, and higher purchase rates from multi-device users for retail sites.</p>
      <p>One thing specifically I’ve been thinking about is the large amount of internet usage from mobile devices, specifically from social media. Traffic from social media sites can almost be guaranteed to be viewed on a mobile device.</p>
      <p>I would very much appreciate if, while contacting me, you helped me out by answering the following questions. This will help me to develop a more enjoyable experience for everyone!<p>
